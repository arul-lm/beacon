This project tries to use TrioSim/Akita discrete event simulator framework to build optical network components

** Assessment of TrioSim
|                        | TrioSim                           | Simpy(Ours)      | Preferred |
|------------------------+-----------------------------------+------------------+-----------|
| ML model supported     | Trace based(Primitive)            | Manually written | Neutral   |
| Parallelism supported  | 1D(No Megatron/DeepSpeed)         | 4D or 5D         | Ours      |
| Training/Inference     | Training. Easy to add inference   | Both             | Neutral   |
| Comp Arch Components   | Ports, Links, Switch, Routers etc | XPUs and Links   | TrioSim   |
| Optical Ntw Components | Waveguide (replaced)              | NA               | TrioSim   |
| Scalability            | Faster                            | Slower           | TrioSim   |
| Debuggability          | More granular                     | Less granular    | Neutral   |
| Event Timeline viz     | DB based                          | Perfetto based   | Ours      |

** Summary
Akita/TrioSim - Good for modeling computer architecture. Needs work to target ML workloads.
Ours - Good for targeting ML workloads with partitioning and less sophisticated for Network modeling.

TrioSim's decision to replace their on-the-fly waveguide setup with direct links significantly dampens our immediate interest to adopt their work.
